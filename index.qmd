# Overview/Welcome {.unnumbered}

This is a Quarto Book that holds most of the materials related to
Eric C. Anderson's presentation at ConGen 2022.

This year Eric is giving two different presentations:

1. An introduction to the idea of probability and inference and how they
are used in using genotype likelihoods for population genetic inference.
2. A short (1 hour) introduction to Snakemake---a flexible and full-featured
workflow management system tailored to bioinformatic processing.

For each of the presentations, there is a narrative description that may be found in the
pages of this book---each presentation constitutes a different chapter of this web-book.  These
chapters can be accessed from the contents links to the left of the page.

There are also slides that Eric will be using during the presentations. They
were made using Quarto's `revealjs` format, and can be accessed here:

* [Probability, Inference and Genotype Likelihoods LECTURE SLIDES](https://eriqande.github.io/con-gen-2022/slides/prob-slides.html)
* [Snakemake Introduction LECTURE SLIDES](https://eriqande.github.io/con-gen-2022/slides/snake-slides.html)

If you haven't heard about Quarto yet, it is RStudio's successor to RMarkdown
for making book, notebooks, and slide presentations.  To learn more about Quarto books visit <https://quarto.org/docs/books>.


Finally, as an aside. If you are starting to get into genomics and bioinformatics,
you might be interested in checking out [Eric's Bioinformatics Handbook](https://eriqande.github.io/eca-bioinf-handbook/) on the web.
It is not complete, but it has some reasonably informative sections within it.
(And it's free!)
