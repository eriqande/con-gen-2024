- Changes in allele frequencies (or merging of lineages)
in that non-WF population happens at the same rate as you
would expect in a Wright-Fisher population of smaller size.

- The _effective size_ of a real populations ($N_e$) is the
size of an ideal (i.e., Wright-Fisher) population that has
similar "genetic behavior" as the real population.

- So, results we obtain with the W-F model can be applied to
real populations by using their effective size.

## Lineages in a Bigger Population for more Generations {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}
![](images/wf-big-lineages.png)



## The Coalescent Describes The Random Process of Lineages Finding Common Ancestors

- Focuses only on the properties of _sampled_ genes/sequences
- Need not consider all the grey individuals (great for simulation)
- Particularly useful for _sequence data_
    - So, think of each of these colored balls as a segment of DNA being
    copied and handed down from one generation to the next.
- Is pretty easy to derive from the Wright-Fisher model
- Ultimately, understanding the coalescent helps you to understand how
different demographic or evolutionary effects will change the genetic data 
you expect to see from populations that you study



## Let's derive the coalescent from the W-F model

- **Start small---focus first on a sample of two gene copies**:
- Consider two gene copies and trace their **lineages** _backwards_ in time:
![](images/wf-2-gen.png)
- Terminology: sampled gene copies in the present become lineages that
travel through gene copies present in previous generations
- Two lineages _coalesce_ in the generation that their common ancestor
lived in.
![](images/wf-2-gen-reord.png)


## Simple probabilities

Let there be $2N$ haploids ($N$ diploids) in a  Wright-Fisher population.

  

The probability that two lineages coalesce (arose from a common ancestor)
one generation in the past is:
$$
\frac{1}{2N}
$$
The probability that they don't coalesce one generation in the past is simply:
$$
1 - \frac{1}{2N}
$$
So, the probability that two lineages coalesce after $t$ generations is
$$
\biggl(1 - \frac{1}{2N}\biggr)^{t - 1}\biggl(\frac{1}{2N}\biggr)
$$

This is a _geometric distribution_.


## The geometric distribution is well-approximated by an exponential distribution with the same mean

::: columns
::: {.column width="65%"}
![](images/geom-and-exp.png)
:::

::: {.column width="35%"}
- So, thinking in continuous time, we can model the waiting time until
a pair of lineages coalesces as an exponential R.V. with mean $2N$.

- An R-notebook that explores this approximation is available at:
[https://eriqande.github.io/coalescent-hands-on/001-exp-approx-to-geometric.nb.html](https://eriqande.github.io/coalescent-hands-on/001-exp-approx-to-geometric.nb.html)
:::

## With $k>2$ lineages, we wait until the first pair coalesces, and then repeat with one less lineage

- With $k$ lineages there are $\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$ _pairs_ of lineages
- Each pair of lineages is independently^[This is one of the interesting assumptions of coalescent that can break down when populations are very small or variance in reproductive success is very large.] waiting to
coalesce as we go back in time.

$$

The time to the coalescence of the first coalescing pair has an
exponential distribution with mean:
$$
2N\frac{2}{k(k-1)} = \frac{4N}{k(k-1)}
$$
After that first pair coalesces, the two lineages involved become a
single lineage and then the process waits for the first coalescence
between a pair of $k-1$ lineages.

And so forth.  

The last two extant lineages coalesce into the "most recent common ancestor" (MRCA) of the sample





## The Anatomy of a Coalescent Tree

:::
:::{.column width="30%"}
- Let $T_k$ be the length of time (number of generations) during which
there are $k$ extant lineages in the sample.
- To the left, $T_{10}$ is the time until the _first_ pair of sampled
gene copies coalesces.
- $T_\mathrm{MRCA}$ is the time to the most recent common ancestor.
    -   i.e., the time it takes for all the lineages to have coalesced
- Recall:
$$
\Exp T_k = \frac{4N}{k(k-1)}
$$

## Vertical Lines are _Generations_

::: columns

![](images/coalescent-10.svg)
:::
:::{.column width="30%"}
- I like to think of the vertical lines (the _branches_) in the coalescent
as strings of beads---each bead is a generation, and there can be a lot
of them.

- Each generation = a meiosis in the lineage

- What can happen during meiosis? (mutation!)

- Neutral mutations do not affect the shape of the tree

- This is the _neutral_ coalescent.  (Selection renders things
much more difficult.)

## Expected Properties of the Coalescent with $n$ tips

### Expected time to the MRCA

::: columns
::: {.column width="58%"}

![](images/coalescent-10.svg)

:::{.column width="42%"}

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Exp T_\mathrm{MRCA} &= \Exp\biggl[T_2 + T_3 + \cdots + T_n\biggr] \\
  &= \sum_{k=2}^n \frac{4N}{k(k-1)} \\
  &= 4N \sum_{k=2}^n \biggl( \frac{1}{k-1} - \frac{1}{k}\biggr) \\
  &= 4N\biggl(1 - \frac{1}{n}\biggr)
\end{aligned}
$$

- Wow!  Even with a huge sample of gene copies (large $n$), the expected time to the MRCA is no more than twice that of a sample of 2 gene copies.

  &= \sum_{k=2}^n \frac{4N}{(k-1)} \\
   &= 4N\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{k}
\end{aligned}
$$

This is the expected number of opportunities (generations/meioses)
for mutations to occur.

## The Neutral Coalescent with Varying Demography

We have already noted that non-neutral mutations violate the assumptions
of the coalescent.

However, many  demographic scenarios can be accommodated in the 
coalescent framework^[Recombination is also well-treated in the coalescent model, though we
won't be discussing that today.]. E.g.:

- Population growth / decline
- Population structure:
    -   Migration
    -   Population splitting
    -   Population joining


Each of these scenarios affect the shape of the coalescent tree.



## How Might Population Size Changes Affect the Tree?

::: columns
::: {.column width="62%"}

![](images/coalescent-10.svg)
:::
:::{.column width="38%"}
- Imagine that the population was larger in the past.  How do you expect that to affect $T_{10}$? What about $T_2$?

- Now, what if the population was smaller in the past?

- We have a short hands-on that lets us simulate, and then visualize, coalescent trees under different demographic scenarios.

## The Scaled Mutation Parameter $\theta = 4N\mu L$

- When we talk about mutation rates, it is common to scale them
by $4N$ or $2N$.  
- `ms` scales them by $4N$.  Why? And what does this mean?
- Let:
    -   $\mu$ be the per-base mutation rate per-generation
    -   $L$ be the number bases in a segment of DNA
- Then $\mu L$ is the probability of a mutation each generation
somewhere in the sequence.
- Recall that $2N$ is the expected time for a pair of sampled genes (sequences) to coalesce in a population of $N$ diploids.
    -   i.e. $\Exp T_2 = 2N$.
- Thus, there the expected number of bases that differ between a pair
of sequences is $4N\mu L$.
- That is the expected number of heterozygous sites between a pair
of sequences.








## The Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS)

- If you have $n$ samples (tips on the tree), then any mutation you see in your sample will occur in some number of samples between 1 and $n - 1$

- Let $S_n^i$ denote the number of mutations that were inherited by $i$ haploid sequences out of a sample of $n$ of them.  

- This is a common way to summarise data in conservation genetics and
contains a lot of information about the history of the sample






## The SFS on our Tiny Example
### Only three SNPs so not very representative!

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}

![](figure-creation/mutations-on-tree-3.svg)
:::
:::{.column width="30%"}
- At the first SNP the mutation is seen in 2 out of 10 samples
- At the 2nd SNP, 7 out of 10 samples.
- At 3rd SNP, 4 out of 10 samples.

So, from this silly, tiny example, we have:
$$
S_{10}^2 = 1~~~~~S_{10}^7 = 1~~~~~~S_{10}^4 = 1
$$
with all other $S_n^i = 0$.

## The Expected SFS of the Neutral Coalescent

In a neutral coalescent with no population structure and constant population size^[A delightful proof of this was published recently in  [Hudson (2015) _PLoS One_ 10(7): e0118087](doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0118087)]:
$$
\Exp S_n^i = \frac{\theta}{i}~~~~\mathrm{for}~1\leq i < n
$$
The key here is the shape.  What does it look like? Here it is for $n=50$ and arbitrary $\theta$:

![](images/sfs.png)

## The site frequency spectrum can be observed

- You can estimate the SFS from genomic data

- By comparing it to the SFS expected under different scenarios, you
can attempt to infer the demographic history of a population

- We won't go into it, but many programs can do this:
    - fastsimcoal
    - dadi, i.e., $\partial a \partial i$
    - moments


- For now, we will simulate some one-dimensional SFS from the coalescent
to gain some intuition about how the shape of the coalescent affects
the one-dimensional SFS.

## Wrap Up

We have only scratched the surface here, but I hope that some of y'all
are convinced that the coalescent is an important topic to study more
for understanding methodology in conservation genomics.
