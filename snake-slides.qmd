## What the Heck is Snakemake? {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

-   A Python-based "Workflow Management System"
-   Allows you to define a complex (bioinformatic) workflow as a series of steps that involve input files and output files.
-   It identifies the dependencies between the steps and then runs all the steps needed to create a *requested output file*.
-   This greatly simplifies the orchestration of bioinformatics, and makes it much easier to find and re-run failed jobs.
-   Incredibly valuable for reproducible research:
    -   Not just so others can reproduce your results
    -   Also useful for you to quickly run your workflow on different clusters, etc.

### That sounds pretty jargony!

-   Illustrate with an example
-   Hope that it piques the curiosity of some

#### A mini data set that only takes about 1.5 minutes to run through the major steps of a GATK-like variant calling workflow

-   Heavily subsampled Chinook salmon reads.
-   Three paired-end fastqs, and data only from three or four chromosomes.
-   We will trim it, map it, mark duplicates, then make one gVCF file per individual.
-   Then, to save time, we call variants only on one chromosome: `CM031202.1`.

## Setting up our workspaces {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
It should be simple to set this up. The code at right does the following:

* `cd` to the Snakemake-Example data directory insdie your home directory
* Activate the `snakemake-example` conda environment.
* Test to make sure that you have `snakemake` on your PATH
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
``` sh
# From the home directory of your ConGen server
cd ~/Snakemake-Example

conda activate snakemake-example

# To make sure it is working, print the help information
# for snakemake
snakemake --help
```
:::
:::

## Initial Configuration of our work directory {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
-   We can use the Unix `tree` utility to see what the Snakemake-Example directory contains.
-   Within the Snakemake-Example directory, type `tree` at the command line. This shows:
    -   A `README.md` with installation instructions
    -   A `Snakefile`. Much more about that later.
    -   A directory `data` with three pairs of FASTQ files
    -   A directory `env` that has information to install necessary software with conda
    -   A directory `resources` that has two subdirectories
        -   `adapters`: info for trimming Illumina adapters
        -   `genome.fasta`: a FASTA file with the reference genome

## How would you tackle this in a Unix way? {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
### Consider the first two "steps"

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
  H(fastq files from 3 samples: our raw data) --> I(Trim the reads: trimmomatic)
  I --> J(Map the reads to a reference genome: bwa mem)
```
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
### Some pseudo-shell code

``` sh
# cycle over fastqs and do the trimming
for S in A B C; do
  trimmomatic data/${S}_R1.fastq.gz data/S{S}_R2.fastq.gz \
    trimmed/${S}_R1.fastq.gz trimmed/${S}_R1_unpaired.fastq.gz \
    trimmed/${S}_R2.fastq.gz trimmed/${S}_R2_unpaired.fastq.gz \
    other-arguments-etc...
done 


# cycle over trimmed fastqs and do the mapping
for S in A B C; do
  bwa mem resources/genome.fasta \
    trimmed/${S}_R1.fastq.gz trimmed/${S}_R2.fastq.gz
done
```

### What are some issues here?

1.  Ah crap! I forgot to index `genome.fasta`!\
2.  This does not run the jobs in parallel!

### Possible solutions for #2?

You can get things done in parallel using SLURM's `sbatch` (which you probably need to use anyway).

# cycle over trimmed fastqs and dispatch each mapping job to SLURM
for S in A B C; do
  sbatch my-map-script $S
done
```

### What is not-so-great about this?

1.  I have to wait for all the jobs of each step to finish
2.  I have to explicitly start each "next" step.
3.  If some jobs of a step fail, it is a PITA to go back and figure out which ones failed.
4.  The dependence between the outputs of the trimming step and the mapping step are implicit based on file paths buried in the scripts, rather than *explicit*.
:::
:::

## The Advantages of Snakemake {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

-   The dependence between input and output files is *explicit*
-   This lets snakemake identify every single job that must be run---and the order they must be run in---for the entire workflow (all the steps)
-   This maximizes the number of jobs that can be run at once.
-   The necessary steps are determined by starting from the ultimate outputs that are desired or requested...
-   ...then working backward through the dependencies to identify which jobs must be run to eventually get the ultimate output.
-   This *greatly* simplifies the problem of re-running any jobs that might have failed for reasons "known only to the cluster."

## Snakemake is a program that interprets a set of rules stored in a *Snakefile* {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Some explanations:

-   Rule blocks: the fundamental unit
-   Correspond to "steps" in the workflow
-   Keyword "rule" + name + colon
-   Indenting like Python/YAML
-   Typically includes sub-blocks of `input`, `output`, and `shell`
-   (Also `params`, `log`, `benchmarks`, `conda`, etc.)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r filename="Snakefile"}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false 
#| file: Snakemake-Example/Snakefile

## A closer look at a simple rule {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

#### (Screen grab from Sublime Text which has great highlighting for Snakemake)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/paste-0238E703.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
The rule:

-   *Requires* the input file `resources/genome.fasta`
-   *Produces* the output file `resources/genome.dict`
-   *Writes to* a log file in `results/logs/genome_dict.log`
-   *Uses* the shell code `samtools dict {input} > {output} 2> {log}` to get the job done
:::
:::

-   What are those purple bits? `{input}`, `{output}`, and `{log}`?! in the shell code?
-   That is the syntax snakemake uses to substitute the values in the *output*, *input*, or *log* blocks (or other blocks...) into the Unix shell command.
- **Big Note**: Output and log information is not written _automatically_ to the
output file and log file, nor is input taken automatically from the input file---you
have to dicate that behavior by what you write in the shell block!
-   Thus, when this rule runs, the shell command executed will be:

::: {style="font-size: 2em;"}
``` sh
samtools dict resources/genome.fasta > resources/genome.dict 2> results/logs/genome_dict.log 
```
:::


## We "drive" Snakemake by requesting the creation of *output files* {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

### These output files are sometimes referred to as "targets"

-   `snakemake` looks for and uses the `Snakefile` in the current working directory.
-   Option `-n` tells snakemake to do a "dry-run:" (Just say what you would do, *but don't do it!*)
-   Option `-p` tells snakemake to print the shell commands of the rules.
-   Those two options can be combined: `-np`
-   And we request `resources/genome.dict` as a target by just putting it on the command line:

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
snakemake -np resources/genome.dict
```
:::

-   And the output you got from that should look like:

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="What the output should look like"}
Building DAG of jobs...

[Fri Sep  2 09:34:41 2022]
rule genome_dict:
    input: resources/genome.fasta
    output: resources/genome.dict
    log: results/logs/genome_dict.log

total              1              1              1

This was a dry-run (flag -n). The order of jobs does not reflect the order of execution.
```
:::

## Let's actually run that! {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

-   Remove the `-np` option and add `--cores 1` to tell snakemake to run the requested jobs on one core

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
snakemake --cores 1 resources/genome.dict
```
:::

-   The output you get looks like what you saw before, but in this case the requested output file has been created.
-   And a log capturing `stderr` (if any) was created:

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="Paste this into your shell to see all the files"}
tree .
```
:::

### The output shows those two new files that were created

:::

## Once a target file is created or updated Snakemake knows it {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

-   If you request the file `resources/genome.dict` from Snakemake now, it tells you that the file is there *and does not need updating*.

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
snakemake -np resources/genome.dict
```
:::

-   Because `resources/genome.dict` already exists (and none of its dependencies have been updated since it was created) Snakemake tells you this:

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="Expected output from Snakemake"}
Building DAG of jobs...
Nothing to be done (all requested files are present and up to date).
```
:::

-   This helps you to not remake output files that don't need remaking!

## Wildcards: How Snakemake manages replication {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

#### Wildcards allow running multiple instances of the same rule on different input files by simple pattern matching

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/paste-89336B81.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

* If we request from Snakemake the file  
`results/trimmed/A_R1.fastq.gz`,
* then, Snakemake recognizes that this matches the _output_ of rule
`trim_reads` with the wildcard `{sample}` replaced by `A`.
* And Snakemake _propagates_ the value `A` of the wildcard 
`{sample}` to the _input_ block.
* Thus Snakemake knows that to create  
`results/trimmed/A_R1.fastq.gz`  
it needs the input files:
    - `data/A_R1.fastq.gz`
    - `data/A_R2.fastq.gz`
:::
:::


## Try requesting those trimmed fastq files {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

* See what snakemake would do when you ask for `results/trimmed/A_R1.fastq.gz`.

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
snakemake -np results/trimmed/A_R1.fastq.gz
```
:::

* Note that you can request files from more than one sample:

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
snakemake -np results/trimmed/A_R1.fastq.gz results/trimmed/B_R1.fastq.gz results/trimmed/C_R1.fastq.gz  
```
:::

* Then, go ahead and run that last one, instructing Snakemake to use three cores

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
snakemake --cores 3 results/trimmed/A_R1.fastq.gz results/trimmed/B_R1.fastq.gz results/trimmed/C_R1.fastq.gz  
```
:::

Note that it will go ahead and start all those jobs independently, and concurrently,
because they do not depend on one another.  This is how Snakemake manages and maximizes 
parallelism.


## Chains of file dependencies {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
* If Snakemake does not find a required input file for a rule that provides
a requested output, it searches through the outputs of all the other rules in the
Snakefile to find a rule that might provide the required input file as one of
its outputs.
* It then schedules all the necessary rules to run.
* This means that an entire workflow with thousands of jobs can be triggered by
requesting a single output file.

### Short Group Activity

* Trace the rules needed if we request the file `results/vcf/all.vcf`. 
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r filename="Snakefile"}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false 
#| file: Snakemake-Example/Snakefile
```
:::
:::

### Helpful notes:

* `expand("results/gvcf/{s}.g.vcf.gz", s=SAMPLES)` is a list of files:

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
```{.sh}
[results/gvcf/A.g.vcf.gz, results/gvcf/B.g.vcf.gz, results/gvcf/C.g.vcf.gz]
```
:::

* `multiext("resources/genome.fasta", ".amb", ".ann", ".bwt", ".pac", ".sa")` is a list
of files:

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
```{.sh .code-overflow-wrap}
[resources/genome.fasta.amb, resources/genome.fasta.ann, resources/genome.fasta.bwt, resources/genome.fasta.pac, resources/genome.fasta.sa]
```
:::



## Let's request `results/vcf/all.vcf` from Snakemake {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

* Let's start with a dry run:

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
snakemake -np results/vcf/all.vcf  
```
:::

* After we look at that, and discuss, let's actually run it, using 2 cores:

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
snakemake -p --cores 2 results/vcf/all.vcf  
```
:::

That should take a minute or two.

* If you try to run the workflow again, Snakemake tells you that you do not need
to, because everything is up to date:  Try running the above line again:

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
snakemake -p --cores 2 results/vcf/all.vcf  
```
:::


## If any inputs change, Snakemake will re-run the rules that depend on the new input {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

* Imagine that the sequencing center calls us to say that there has been a terrible mistake and they are sending you new (and correct) versions of data for sample C: `C_R1.fastq.gz` and `C_R2.fastq.gz` 
* Snakemake uses file modification dates to check if any inputs have been updated after target outputs have been created.
* So we can simulate new fastq files for sample C by using the `touch` command to update the fastq file modification dates:

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
touch data/C_R1.fastq.gz data/C_R2.fastq.gz
```
:::

* Now, when we run Snakemake again, it tells us we have to run more jobs, _but only the ones that depend on data from sample C_.  Do a dry run to check that:

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
snakemake -np results/vcf/all.vcf
```
:::

* Check that it will not re-run the trimming, mapping, and gvcf-making steps for samples
A and B, which are already done.  


## Snakemake makes it very easy to re-run failed jobs {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

* Clusters and computers fail (sometimes for no apparent reason) occasionally
* If this happens in a large, traditionally managed (Unix script) workflow, finding and
re-running the failures can be hard.
* Example: 7 birds out of 192 fail on HaplotypeCaller because those jobs got sent to nodes without AVX acceleration.
* Five years ago, setting up custom scripts to re-run just those 7 birds could cost me an hour---about as much time as it takes me now to set up an entire workflow with Snakemake.
* On the next slide we are going to create a job failure to see how easy it is to
re-run jobs that failed with Snakemake.


## Simulating a job failure as an example {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

* First, let's remove the entire `results` directory, so that we have to re-run most of
our workflow.

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
rm -rf results
```
:::

* Now, we are going to corrupt the read-2 fastq file for sample A (but keeping a copy
of the original)

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
cp data/A_R2.fastq.gz data/A_R2.fastq.gz-ORIG
echo "GARBAGE_DATA" | gzip -c > data/A_R2.fastq.gz
```
:::

* Now, do a dry-run, requesting `results/vcf/all.vcf`

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
snakemake -np results/vcf/all.vcf
```
:::

The output ends telling us that 14 jobs will be run:

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="End of the expected output"}

```
:::


* Now, run it with 2 cores and give it the `--keep-going` command which means
that even if an error occurs on one job, all the other jobs _that don't depend
on outputs from the failed job_ will still get run.

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
snakemake --cores 2 --keep-going results/vcf/all.vcf
```
:::

* Snakemake tells us that 8 of the 14 jobs were successful but at least
one job failed:

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="Snakemake's concluding comments:"}
8 of 14 steps (57%) done

:::

Cool! It tells us explicitly which jobs remain to be run. And they are exactly the
ones that depend on outputs from sample A.
  
  
Here is a related, fun tip: Snakemake writes the log of every real (i.e., without the `-n` option) run into a log file in `.snakemake/log`.  Try this:
```sh
ls .snakemake/log
```
If you want to get the log from the most recent run you can throw
down some Unix:
```sh
ls -l .snakemake/log/*.log | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $NF}'
```
You can use that to find any lines that say `Error` in them to tell
you more about the job that failed.  e.g.:
```sh
grep Error $(ls -l .snakemake/log/*.log | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $NF}')
```
  
  
  
  
  

## Re-running failed jobs is as simple as just re-starting Snakemake {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

* First off, after a failure like that, we can always immediately do a dry-run to see what Snakemake must still do to finish out the workflow:

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
snakemake -np results/vcf/all.vcf
```
:::

It is only going to require 6 more jobs to produce `results/vcf/all.vcf`:

* We see that it still has to do 1 trim job, which is the one that failed.

* If we noticed that `data/A_R2.fastq.gz` was corrupted, we could replace it
with the uncorrupted version:

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
cp data/A_R2.fastq.gz-ORIG data/A_R2.fastq.gz
```
:::



* Then, start it back up with 2 cores:

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
snakemake --cores 2 results/vcf/all.vcf
```
:::

Now that sample A is not corrupted, it finishes.  Yay! That was easy.


## Snakemake encourages (requires?) that your outputs all reside in a _consistent_ directory structure {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

#### (And a side note: Snakemake automatically creates all the diretories needed to store its output files)

* Check out all the outputs of our workflow in an easy-to-understand directory structure within `results`:

::: {style="font-size: 1.7em;"}
``` {.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
# only drill down three directory levels (-L 3)
tree -L 3 results
```
:::

Here is what the result looks like:

## Letting Snakemake interface with SLURM

The way to most easily allow Snakemake to dispatch jobs via the SLURM
scheduler is by way of the Snakemake `cluster` option provided in a
Snakemake profile.

A Snakemake profile is a YAML file in which you can record command line options
(and their arguments) for Snakemake.

There is an officially supported Snakemake profile for SLURM, but I am
partial to the Unix-based (as opposed to Python-based) approach to SLURM
profiles for Snakemake described at: 
[https://github.com/jdblischak/smk-simple-slurm](https://github.com/jdblischak/smk-simple-slurm).



## A Snakemake profile for SLURM on `Alpine`
#### Alpine is the new NSF-funded cluster in Colorado

- A Snakemake profile is simply a collection of command line arguments
stored in a YAML file.

- The `set-resources` and `threads` blocks are specific to my lcWGS workflow

```{.yaml filename="Contents of hpcc-profiles/slurm/alpine/config.yaml"}

## We've only scratched the surface {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

* You can specify fine-grained conda environments for each rule
* Python code is allowed in most places in the Snakefile
* _Input functions_ can be quite useful (or absolutely essential)
* You can benchmark every job instance of a rule, which records the resources used (time, memory, etc.)


## Benchmarking jobs

This is super easy.  You add to each rule a path for a benchmark file. For example:
```{.yaml}
rule map_reads:
  input:
    r1="results/trimmed/{sample}_R1.fastq.gz",
    r2="results/trimmed/{sample}_R2.fastq.gz",
    genome="resources/genome.fasta",
    idx=multiext("resources/genome.fasta", ".amb", ".ann", ".bwt", ".pac", ".sa")
  output:
    "results/bam/{sample}.bam"
  log:
    "results/logs/map_reads/{sample}.log"
  benchmark:
    "results/benchmarks/map_reads/{sample}.bmk"
  params:
    RG="-R '@RG\\tID:{sample}\\tSM:{sample}\\tPL:ILLUMINA' "
  shell:
    " (bwa mem {params.RG} {input.genome} {input.r1} {input.r2} | "
    " samtools view -u | "
    " samtools sort - > {output}) 2> {log} "

```

Then, each time that rule gets run (with a different wildcard) you get a little
file like this:
```{.tsv}
s	h:m:s	max_rss	max_vms	max_uss	max_pss	io_in	io_out	mean_load	cpu_time
164.7159	0:02:44	293.05	3523.55	263.11	269.15	1740.09	0.12	76.83	127.05
```

- This tells you how many seconds it ran (`s`), the max RAM use (`max_rss`), 
amount of data read from disk and written to disk, total
amount of CPU time, etc.
- Super helpful
- Easy to extract

## Where to from here? {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

* Complete documentation for Snakemake: [https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* The official Snakemake tutorial: [https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/tutorial.html#tutorial](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/tutorial.html#tutorial)


You might be interested in having a look at a workflow I wrote for whole genome sequencing
of non-model organisms: [https://github.com/eriqande/mega-non-model-wgs-snakeflow](https://github.com/eriqande/mega-non-model-wgs-snakeflow).

This provides a complete BWA-GATK workflow including an arbitrary number of "bootstrapped-BQSR" rounds (which turn out to be pretty useless...)


### Setting this up for yourself

To use Snakemake on your own server/cluster/laptop you should:

1. Install Mambaforge as described [here](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mamba-installation.html#fresh-install-recommended) 
2. Create a new conda environment for snakemake as described [here](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)
```sh
# i.e.:
mamba create -c conda-forge -c bioconda -n snakemake snakemake
```
3. Then:
```
conda activate snakemake
```

Some notes: `mamba` is far faster (and better in almost all cases) than `conda`.
It is also practically required for using snakemake conda blocks.




## Final Thoughts {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}


* Learning snakemake may require a bit of an investment, BUT...
* For anyone doing a lot of bioinformatic processing of sequence data it is
quite a sound investment.


#### One final step on the command line:

```{.sh}
conda deactivate
```
